## Project Scope
This project aims to analyze multiple datasets related to TechTech's product campaign metrics and address the business challenges through structured data analysis. The datasets explored include:
- Competitor Campaigns
- TechTech Marketing Campaigns
- Customer Data
- External Economic Factors

The project focused on evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, identifying customer behavior patterns, and understanding the influence of external factors on campaign success.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning
The analysis began by examining the structure and content of each dataset to ensure data quality. Several steps were taken to clean the datasets:

- **Competitor Campaigns Dataset**: Consists of 100 rows and 9 columns, with necessary date conversion and data type adjustments for numerical values.
- **Customers Dataset**: Contains 100 rows and 5 columns; no major cleaning issues identified.
- **External Factors Dataset**: Includes 365 rows of daily data, with date conversion required for proper time-based analysis.
- **Marketing Campaigns Dataset**: Contains 200 rows and 9 columns, requiring date conversion and ensuring data types are suitable for analysis.

## Tools Used: Looker

Looker was the primary business intelligence tool used for this analysis due to its powerful data exploration, integration, and reporting capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Looker allowed seamless uploading, exploring, and cleaning of datasets. We corrected data types, handled missing values, and ensured data integrity for analysis.
- **Data Blending:** Using the "Manage Blends" feature, we joined datasets (e.g., Marketing Campaigns with Customers via `Customer_ID`) and connected campaign data with external factors based on date fields for comprehensive analysis.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Looker provided visual insights through bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to explore key metrics like ROI, impressions, and conversions. Custom reports and calculated fields (e.g., ROI) were used to measure campaign performance.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Interactive dashboards in Looker made it easy to present and explore data in real-time, supporting informed decision-making through clear visual storytelling.

Looker’s real-time exploration, powerful blending, and visualization tools were crucial for analyzing TechTech’s marketing campaigns and driving actionable insights.

## Data Integration and Blending
To derive meaningful insights, datasets were integrated based on common keys and relevant time periods:

- **Marketing Campaigns and Customers**: Linked via Customer_ID to analyze customer responses to campaigns.
- **Campaigns and External Factors**: Linked by dates to assess the impact of external factors such as GDP growth, inflation, and consumer sentiment on marketing performance.
- **Competitor Campaigns and Marketing Campaigns**: Although not directly connected, these datasets were used to compare key metrics like Ad Spend, Clicks, and ROI.

## Data Visualization

Visualizations were essential in making the data insights more accessible and understandable. Using Looker's robust visualization tools, various charts and graphs were created to explore campaign performance, customer demographics, and external factors. These visualizations helped to quickly identify trends, compare metrics, and present complex data in an easily digestible format. For instance, bar charts were used to compare the ROI, impressions, and sales of TechTech’s marketing campaigns against those of its competitors, providing a clear, side-by-side view of performance metrics. This enabled easy identification of TechTech’s higher ad spend and conversion rates, as well as areas where competitors demonstrated more consistent returns.

In addition to bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps were utilized to visualize customer demographics. Pie charts effectively displayed the distribution of customer segments, age groups, and gender within TechTech’s customer base, offering insights into which demographics were most engaged with the marketing campaigns. Line graphs were also employed to track external factors such as GDP growth, inflation rates, and consumer sentiment over time, providing a time-series view of how these factors correlated with campaign outcomes. Overall, the visualizations not only made the data analysis more intuitive but also supported data-driven decision-making by clearly highlighting key areas for optimization and growth.
