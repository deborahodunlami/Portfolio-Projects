## Introduction:
HR attrition data from a fictional pharmaceutical company called BioGenesis Pharmaceuticals that operates at the intersection of scientific research, manufacturing, and sales within the healthcare sector in California. The data contains details about 1,470 employees and it includes details about the employeeâ€™s education, gender, age, job role, marital status, and a lot more.
## Role Played:
I have been hired as a BI consultant to help the company improve staff retention and understand the organizational dynamics by identifying the job satisfaction rating and also factors contributing to employee loss.
## Tools Used:
- Pivot Tables for Data Analysis
- Microsoft Excel for Data Visualization
## Executive Summary (Insights & Analysis):
According to the data, personnel with bachelor's degrees, Laboratory Technicians, and those aged 25-34 had the greatest attrition rates, emphasizing the need for stronger career development and engagement methods. The R&D department and single workers had the highest turnover, suggesting that these groups should benefit from concentrated retention efforts. Overall, concentrating on job happiness, career advancement, and work-life balance has the potential to considerably minimize turnover and boost employee stability.
## Attrition Overview:
The company's attrition rate is 16.12%, with 237 of its 1,470 workers leaving. Attrition rates are greatest in the R&D department, among personnel with bachelor's degrees and those aged 25 to 34. Single employees also have a far greater tendency to leave the company, highlighting the need for focused retention strategies for these groups.
## Overall Attrition Rate Analysis:
The HR Attrition Dashboard gives a comprehensive overview of employee attrition, including categories for educational qualifications, job responsibilities, departments, age groups, and marital status. The bar chart demonstrating education-based attrition shows that employees with a bachelor's degree have the greatest turnover rates, followed by those with a master's degree. Associate degree and high school diploma holders have lower attrition rates, whilst doctorate holders have the lowest. This discovery implies that educational background has a major impact on employee retention, maybe owing to differing work satisfaction levels and career growth chances.<br/>
A treemap of attrition by job role shows that the greatest attrition rates are seen in laboratory technician and sales executive positions. This trend emphasizes the need for focused interventions in these particular job roles to address underlying concerns such as job satisfaction, workload, and career advancement prospects. A pie chart of department-wise attrition demonstrates that the Sales and Research & Development (R&D) departments have the greatest attrition rates. This necessitates a more thorough assessment of departmental rules and procedures that may be leading to greater turnover.<br/>
Furthermore, a bar chart illustrating attrition by age category shows that younger workers, especially those aged between the ages of 25 and 34, have the greatest attrition rate. Employee turnover rates tend to drop as they age, suggesting that younger workers may be looking for better opportunities or confronting issues that must be handled. Furthermore, a funnel chart illustrating attrition by marital status demonstrates that single workers have a greater attrition rate than their married colleagues.
## Key Drivers of Attrition:
- High attrition rates among employees with lower educational qualifications suggest limited career advancement opportunities and job dissatisfaction.
-	Elevated attrition rates in sales executive and laboratory technician roles point to potential issues with job satisfaction and workload.
-	High attrition in Sales and R&D departments may indicate departmental policies or work environments that need improvement.
-	Younger employees (18-25) showing higher attrition rates likely seek better opportunities or face challenges that are not adequately addressed.
-	Higher attrition rates among single employees could be driven by a need for greater work-life balance or career development opportunities.
## Recommendations:
1.	Regularly perform exit interviews to gather detailed feedback from departing employees to understand their reasons for leaving and identify areas for improvement.
2.	Implement structured career development programs that provide clear pathways for advancement, continuous learning opportunities, and professional growth to keep employees motivated and engaged.
3.	Introduce tailored support mechanisms such as stress management workshops, realistic target setting, and performance-based incentives to reduce attrition in the Sales department.
4.	Develop specific retention initiatives for high-attrition groups, including competitive compensation packages, flexible work arrangements, and recognition programs for employees in high-turnover job roles.
5.	Create a more engaging workplace environment for single employees by offering social events, team-building activities, and support networks that foster a sense of community and belonging.
6.	Establish mentorship and coaching programs to provide guidance, support, and career advice to employees, particularly younger staff and those in high-attrition roles.
7.	Promote a healthy work-life balance through policies that include flexible working hours, remote work options, and wellness programs to enhance employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.
8.	Establish regular feedback mechanisms such as surveys and focus groups to continuously gather employee input and make data-driven improvements to workplace policies and culture.
## Conclusion:
By implementing targeted retention strategies, the company can significantly reduce attrition rates and enhance employee satisfaction across various departments and roles. These efforts will lead to a more engaged and motivated workforce, ultimately contributing to the company's long-term success and stability.
